    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There are some recipes that take the mind back in time and among them is wild boar stew. 
    </br>So different from the modern and almost minimalist preparations to which we are accustomed, 
    </br>this one does not stop losing its appeal although fewer and fewer people decide to try their hand at this delicacy. 
    </br>In fact, if the goodness of wild boar stew is unquestionable, the same cannot be said about the speed of its preparation.
    </p>
    <p>The recipe for wild boar stew takes time: first, for the meat to lose its wild flavor (hence the marinating with wine),
    </br>and then for the cooking, which is long and slow and indispensable for obtaining soft and succulent meat. In short, 
    </br>you will have realized that it takes patience but we guarantee that this will be abundantly repaid once brought to the table. 
    </br>Ready to get to work? </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        </br>Also chop a peeled carrot, celery stalk and onion and add them to the bowl
        </br>along with half of the herbs, cloves and peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Cover with red wine, stir and let marinate covered with a clean dishcloth for 8 hours 
        </br>you can do this in the evening and prepare the recipe the next day. Why Red Wine. 
        </br>It will help remove the "wild" taste from the meat.</li>

        <li>After the marinating time has elapsed, drain the meat and vegetables by tipping them into a colander. 
        </br>In a saucepan, brown chopped celery, carrot, onion and garlic with a few tablespoons of oil.</li>

        <li>Then add the shredded meat and herbs, then remove the herbs and deglaze with a glass of red wine.</li>

        <li>Add the tomato pulp and begin cooking. It will take about 4 hours during which you will stir occasionally, 
        </br>adding hot water if necessary if it gets too dry. In fact, the meat should always be just barely covered</li>

        <li>About halfway through cooking, or at any rate after a couple of hours, adjust the salt.
        </br>Only at the end of cooking season with cinnamon and nutmeg.
        </br>As soon as the meat is nicely tender, your boar stew is ready to serve. </li>
    </ol>
