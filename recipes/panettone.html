    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>The king of all holidays is definitely panettone. Together with pandoro, 
    </br>it is the Christmas lunch dessert par excellence that, although of Lombard origin, 
    </br>is present on all Italians' tables on this Holy Day. 
    </br>Preparing it at home is a small challenge that many choose to take up, 
    </br>along with other recipes of the period such as nougat! 
    </br>Today we will help you tackle it on the right foot, 
    </br>thanks to one of the best recipes from master confectioner Alfonso Pepe. 
    </br>Contrary to what it may seem, it is not such an arduous task... 
    </br>you just need to be patient and take your time in the preparation because 
    </br>panettone requires quite a long leavening time. In fact, in the version we present, 
    </br>the panettone has been prepared using natural yeast; this will allow for a soft texture 
    </br>that will keep for a long time and a richer aroma! Set the holiday table with Christmas sweets, 
    </br>but for a perfect Christmas, panettone cannot be missed... </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>preparation of the first dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the panettone, start by making the first dough. Pour into a bowl the malt, 
            </br>the 65 g of caster sugar and the 125 g of water at room temperature .
            </br>Mix with a whisk until the sugar is dissolved; then pour the syrup into a planetary mixer fitted with a leaf whisk. 
            </br>Then add the 250 g of manitoba flour at once and start kneading .</li>
        <li>t will take about 5 minutes and as soon as the dough has taken consistency add 65g of sourdough 
            </br>starter refreshed 3 times during the day and continue kneading at moderate speed. 
            </br>Meanwhile, prepare an emulsion of butter and egg yolks. 
            </br>Transfer 70 g of soft butter to a small bowl and process with a hand whisk until creamy. 
            </br>Add about half of the egg yolks and mix.</li>
        <li>Then add the remainder and mix again so as to obtain a homogeneous emulsion . 
            </br>At this point add half to the running planetary mixer .</li>
        <li> aid absorption by using a drip pan, detach the dough that will have stuck to the leaf and run the planetary mixer again 
            </br>at medium speed. When the dough is well dry and the butter has been completely absorbed add the remaining part
            </br>of the butter and egg yolk emulsion 13. Knead again until the dough is smooth and homogeneous, 
            </br>then transfer it to a work surface, helping yourself with a mallet </li>
        <li>ve the dough a spherical shape , transfer it to the inside of a glass bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 
            </br>about 12 hours at a temperature of about 26° until the dough has tripled in volume. In the meantime, 
            </br>if you prefer to make your own mandarin, orange or lemon dough at home watch the box at the bottom.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>preparation of the second dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>For the second panettone dough using a tarot, detach the first (risen) dough from the glass bowl 
            </br>and transfer it to the planetary mixer, still fitted with a leaf. Add 65 g of manitoba flour and run 
            </br>the machine at moderate speed until fully absorbed. Next add the aromatic masses, namely orange paste, 
            </br>mandarin paste and lemon paste ; then add the honey and the seeds of the vanilla bean. 
            </br>Run the planetary mixer again until the flavors are completely absorbed. In the meantime, 
            </br>prepare the emulsion again with 40 g butter and 50 g egg yolks, combining them twice as done previously.
        </li>
        <li>As soon as your dough is elastic, turn off the machine and add 50 g sugar. 
            </br>Run the machine again for a few minutes and add a pinch of salt. Let it absorb and turn off the planetary mixer again. 
            </br>Add the butter emulsion again in two times and finish kneading the dough until it is well strung. 
            </br>Meanwhile, soak the raisins 11 and dice both the citron and candied orange.</li>
        <li>At this point drain the raisins well and pour them into a bowl, also add orange and citron and mix. 
            </br>To be sure that the dough is ready, turn off the machine, take a portion and if by spreading it with your hands 
            </br>it is thin but does not break easily, it means that it has reached the right elacisticity; 
            </br>if not, knead the dough a few more minutes, otherwise add the candied fruit and raisin mix to the planetary mixer 
            </br>and run it again at moderate speed.</li>
        <li>When the candied fruit mixture and raisins are well incorporated turn off the machine, detach the leaf and let the dough rest
            </br>for about 20 minutes inside the bowl of the planetary mixer, covering it with a dish towel. 
            </br>After that, transfer it to a flat surface, give it a few folds and let it rest for another 30 minutes at room temperature; 
            </br>there will be no need to cover it. Don't worry if the dough turns out a bit sticky help yourself to it by using a tarot.</li>
        
    </ol>
    
    <h4>To form and bake the panettone</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After the 30 minutes have elapsed, take 1050 g of dough, round gently to give a spherical shape and transfer inside a 1 kg paper mold 
            </br>(exact dimensions are 22 cm in diameter and 8 cm high) . Use the remaining dough (about 150 g) to make two small panettoncini using muffin molds. 
            </br>Heat the oven to 35°, then turn it off, cover the panettone with a glass dome and place the panettone and panettoncini to rise in the oven for 6 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Once it has risen, leave it uncovered at room temperature for about 30 minutes, so a thin skin will form on the surface. 
            </br>With a paring knife make a cross-shaped incision and place a knob of butter in the center of the cross. 
            </br>Bake at 175° in static mode for 50 minutes; after 20-25 minutes, take the panettoncini out of the oven and continue baking the panettone 
            </br>for the remaining minutes. Then take it out of the oven and pierce it with 2 steel toothpicks on the two outer edges. 
            </br>Let it cool upside down overnight, using two pans or two bowls of the same height to secure it. 
            </br>The next morning turn it over, remove the toothpicks, and your panettone will be ready to enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
