    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>There's something a little  bit suspicious abut the origin story of this "to die for"
    </br>pasta's name. Sure, a customer jokingly asking the chef ifthey're trying to "kill them"
    </br>with this intensely flavored Spaghetti all'assassina is sort of believable,
    </br>but i've always felt like there was much more to the story. Hey, can we get a few
    </br>of these true crime podcasters on the case?
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, regardless of the real story (possibly involving the Medicis, and
    </br>probably also the Opus Dei), this spicy, partially pan-fried spaghetti dish is as 
    </br>unusual as it is addictively delicious. As the head assassin, you get to decided 
    </br>exactly how spicy and charred this gets, but as I said in the video, the sweetness 
    </br>and acidity of the caramelized tomato sauce balances the heat from the chili 
    </br>flakes, so don't worry about using a heavy hand.</p>
    <p>The cheater method for this recipe involves boiling the spaghetti for four or five 
    </br>minutes first, then draining, before pan-frying and saucing as shown. This may
    </br>be a little more user-friendly method, but you just won't get the same, very 
    </br>unique texture. Having said that, if you have a large non-stick, or very well 
    </br>seasoned cast iron pan, this really isn't hard to pull off. 
    </br>Either way, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>320g spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 dry peppers</li>
        <li>1 tube of tomato paste</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare spaghetti all'assassina as first thing, devote yourself to the broth. 
        </br>Boil the tomato paste and salt in plenty of water. In an iron skillet, brown the 
        </br>garlic cloves and chopped dried chili pepper in oil. Add the tomato puree and stir. 
        </br>Season with salt.</li>

        <li>At this point add the raw spaghetti: move them around slightly with the help of a wooden fork
        </br>or spatula so that they season. And let them stick to the bottom of the pan: once you feel 
        </br>that they have stuck, add a ladle of broth and continue cooking. </li>

        <li>When the broth has been absorbed, add another ladleful, turn the noodle so that the part that 
        </br>was previously on top lies on the bottom, and continue cooking. Proceed in this way until cooked through. 
        </br>Be careful, however, not to move the noodles around too much: obviously they should not burn, 
        </br>but the secret is to make the noodles stick to the pan evenly so that they take on a crispy texture and a brown color. </li>
